# Seazone_challange_weather_api

Explanation of my code: 

	
In the first moment, I used the requests module to get the data from an API, that
one suggested in the description of this challenge. After this it was time to filter
the data from the api that I was interested in and save it into a csv file called
“jurere_forecast.csv”. To save multiple times in the csv I used a method to eliminate
 duplicates and save it into the same file. In the end I just filter the
data from the csv to answer the question.
